<p>To-do lists are notorious for collecting junk: things that you want to remember, but aren't important enough to do any time soon.</p>

<p>Bloccitoff aims to keep to-do lists manageable and clutter-free by automatically deleting to-do items that haven't been completed after seven days. The hypothesis is that if the to-do item doesn't get done in seven days, it doesn't belong in your face.</p>
