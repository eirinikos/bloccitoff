<p>To-do lists are notorious for collecting junk: to-do items that you want to remember, but are not very important and thus get consistently put-off.

Blocitoff aims to keep to-do lists manageable and clutter-free by automatically deleting to-do items that haven't been completed after seven days. The hypothesis is that if the to-do item doesn't get done in seven days, it doesn't belong in your face.</p>
